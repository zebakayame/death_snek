# Death_snek

A roulet where each time you loose, a random file of your computer will be executed

If you want to play just copy the code or compile it and run it as administrator or else it's not fun...

For winning, you need to be the half of the map size

Also you can cross the border and get teleported right at the opposite so don't worry

Have fun
